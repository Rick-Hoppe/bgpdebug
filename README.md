# bgpdebug
Bash script that automates all debug steps from sk101399 for debugging BGP and the RouteD daemon of Check Point Security Gateways.

All output and logfiles are put together in a single directory for further investigation (by TAC). Security Gateways in VSX Mode and Security Gateways in Gateway Mode are both supported.
